   09 - LegalCaseHeaders (final export section)
   Purpose:
     • Include ALL OPEN cases
     • Include CLOSED cases if they had activity within the lookback window
     • Allow the combined display ("legalDisplay") to be literally 'Closed'
   Inputs / Assumptions:
     • Legal            (Yardi Legal header)
     • LegalLookup      (keyed by hMy, pHmy for status/flash/combined)
     • LegalActions     (Yardi legal actions table)  -- adjust name if different
     • UnpaidAR_ByTenant view/CTE may be replaced with your AR seed if needed
